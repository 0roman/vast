The `spawn source pcap` command spawns a PCAP source inside the node and is the
analog to the `import pcap` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the commands [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
pcap`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-pcap).
