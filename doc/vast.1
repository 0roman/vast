.SH NAME
.PP
\fB\fCvast\fR \-\- interface to a VAST node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCvast\fR [\fIoptions\fP] \fIcommand\fP [\fIarguments\fP]
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
VAST is a distributed platform for large\-scale network forensics. Its modular
system architecture is exclusively implemented in terms of the actor model. In
this model, concurrent entities (actors) execute in parallel and
communicate asynchronously solely via message passing. Users spawn system
components as actors and connect them together to create a custom system
topology.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fB\fCvast\fR executable enables users to manage an ecosystem, such as creating
event sources and sinks for data import/export, issuing queries, or retrieving
statistics about system components.
.PP
The following key actors exist:
.TP
\fBNODE\fP
The main VAST actor which accommodates all other actors and manages global
state. Use 
.BR vastd (1) 
to start a NODE.
.TP
\fBSOURCE\fP
Generates events from a data source, such as packets from a network interface
or log files.
.TP
\fBSINK\fP
Receives events as the result of a query and displays them in specific output
format, such as JSON, PCAP (for packets), or Bro logs.
.TP
\fBARCHIVE\fP
Compressed bulk storage of the all events.
.TP
\fBINDEX\fP
Accelerates queries by constructing bitmap indexes over a subset of the event
data.
.TP
\fBIMPORTER\fP
Accepts events from SOURCEs, assigns them unique 64\-bit IDs, and relays
them to ARCHIVE and INDEX.
.TP
\fBEXPORTER\fP
Accepts query expressions from users, asks INDEX for hits, takes them to
ARCHIVE to extract candidates, and relays matching events to SINKs.
them to ARCHIVE and INDEX.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The \fIoptions\fP in front of \fIcommand\fP control how to to connect to a node.
.PP
The following \fIoptions\fP are available:
.TP
\fB\fC\-d\fR \fIdir\fP [\fI\&.\fP]
The directory for logs and state.
.TP
\fB\fC\-e\fR \fIendpoint\fP [\fI127.0.0.1:42000\fP]
The endpoint of the node to connect to or launch. (See below)
.TP
\fB\fC\-l\fR \fIverbosity\fP [\fI3\fP]
The logging verbosity. (See below)
.TP
\fB\fC\-h\fR
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\fC\-v\fR
Print VAST version and exit.
.SS endpoint
.PP
An endpoint has the format \fIhost:port\fP where \fIhost\fP is a hostname or IP address
and \fIport\fP the transport\-layer port of the listening daemon. Either can be
omitted: \fIhost\fP or \fI:port\fP are also valid endpoints. IPv6 addresses must be
enclosed in brackets in conjunction with a \fIport\fP, e.g., \fI[::1]:42001\fP\&.
.SS verbosity
.PP
The verbosity controls the amount of status messages displayed on console and
in log files. It can take on the following values:
    \fI0\fP \fI(quiet)\fP: do not produce any output
    \fI1\fP \fI(error)\fP: report failures which constitute a program error
    \fI2\fP \fI(warn)\fP: notable issues that do not affect correctness
    \fI3\fP \fI(info)\fP: status messages representing system activity
    \fI4\fP \fI(verbose)\fP: more fine\-grained activity reports
    \fI5\fP \fI(debug)\fP: copious low\-level implementation details
    \fI6\fP \fI(trace)\fP: log function entry and exit

    timestamp differences. If the PCAP source encounters a packet \fIp1\fP after a
    previous packet \fIp0\fP with timestamps \fIt1\fP and \fIt0\fP, then it will sleep for

.SS quit
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIquit\fP \fIname\fP
.PP
Terminates an actor. The argument \fIname\fP refers to an actor label.
.SS send
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIrun\fP \fIname\fP \fImessage\fP
.PP
Sends a message to an actor. The argument \fIname\fP refers to the actor to run.
The argument \fImessage\fP represents the data to send to the actor.
.PP
Available messages:
.TP
\fIrun\fP
Tells an actor to start operating. Most actors do not need to be told to run
explicitly. Only actors having a multi\-stage setup phase (e.g., sources and
exporters) can be run explicitly: after spawning one connects them with other
actors before they run in a fully operating state.
.TP
\fIflush\fP
Tells an actor to flush its state to the file system.
.SS connect
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIconnect\fP \fIA\fP \fIB\fP
.PP
Connects two actors named \fIA\fP and \fIB\fP by registering \fIA\fP as source for \fIB\fP and
\fIB\fP as sink for \fIA\fP\&.
.PP
Both \fIA\fP and \fIB\fP can consist of a comma\-separated lists of actor labels. That
is, if \fIA\fP consists of \fIn\fP list entries and \fIB\fP of \fIm\fP, then the number
created connections equals to the cross product \fIn * m\fP\&.
.SS disconnect
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIdisconnect\fP \fIA\fP \fIB\fP
.PP
Removes a previously established connection between \fIA\fP and \fIB\fP\&.
.PP
As in \fB\fCconnect\fR, Both \fIA\fP and \fIB\fP can consist of a comma\-separated lists of
actor labels.
.SS import
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIimport\fP \fIformat\fP [\fIspawn\-arguments\fP]
.PP
Imports data on standard input and send it to locally running node. This
command is a shorthand for spawning a source, connecting it with an importer,
and associating standard input of the process invoking \fIimport\fP with the input
stream of the spawned source.
.PP
Because \fIimport\fP always reads from standard input, \fI\-r file\fP has no effect.
.SS export
.PP
Synopsis:
.IP
\fIexport\fP [\fIarguments\fP] \fIexpression\fP
.PP
Issues a query and exports results to standard output. This command is a
shorthand for spawning a exporter and sink, linking the two, and relaying the
resulting event stream arriving at the sink to standard output of the process
invoking \fIexport\fP\&.
.PP
Because \fIexport\fP always writes to standard output, \fI\-w file\fP has no effect.
