### API

VAST exposes a RESTful API to issue queries and ingest data.
The file [api.raml](api.raml) documents this API in [RAML][raml].

Currently, [apiworkbench][apiworkbench] seems the only reasonable piece of
software which supports RAML 1.0.

Details about how to generate the spec will follow here.
