Non-relocateeable VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and
plugins in directories relative to the binary location. Vice versa, relocateable
VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and plugins in their
original install directory, and instead always use paths relative to their
binary location. On macOS, we now always build relocatable binaries.
Relocateable binaries now work correctly on systems where the libary install
directory is `lib64` instead of `lib`.
