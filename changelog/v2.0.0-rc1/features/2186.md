VAST v1.0 deprecated the experimental aging feature. Given popular demand we've
decided to un-deprecate it and to actually implement it on top of the same
building blocks the compaction mechanism uses, which means that it is now fully
working and no longer considered experimental.

The new `filter` transform step is the inverse of the `select` transform step,
removing rows matching a configurable expression rather than keeping them.
