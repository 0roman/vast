We now offer a [`tenzir/vast-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast-dev)
variant besides the regular
[`tenzir/vast`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast) Docker images that is
designed to be used in development contexts, e.g., when building additional
plugins. The image contains the build-time dependencies of VAST and runs as the
`root` rather than the `vast` user.
