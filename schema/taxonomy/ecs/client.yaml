- concept:
    name: ecs.client.address
    description: >
      Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
      sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
      store the raw address in the `.address` field.

      Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
      one it is.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.ip
    description: >
      IP address of the client (IPv4 or IPv6).
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.port
    description: >
      Port of the client.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.mac
    description: >
      MAC address of the client.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.domain
    description: >
      Client domain.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.registered_domain
    description: >
      The highest registered client domain, stripped of the subdomain.

      For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

      This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix
      list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply
      taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.top_level_domain
    description: >
      The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
      is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain
      for example.com is "com".

      This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix
      list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply
      taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as
      "co.uk".
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.subdomain
    description: >
      The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all
      of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a
      partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the
      full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names
      below the registered domain.

      For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east".
      If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
      the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.bytes
    description: >
      Bytes sent from the client to the server.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.packets
    description: >
      Packets sent from the client to the server.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.nat.ip
    description: >
      Translated IP of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to
      internet).

      Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
- concept:
    name: ecs.client.nat.port
    description: >
      Translated port of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to
      internet).

      Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
