    name: ecs.agent.version
    description: >
      Version of the agent.
- concept:
    name: ecs.agent.build.original
    description: >
      Extended build information for the agent.

      This field is intended to contain any build information that a data
      source may provide, no specific formatting is required.
- concept:
    name: ecs.agent.name
    description: >
      Custom name of the agent.

      This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if
      for example two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but
      a human readable separation is needed on which Filebeat instance data
      is coming from.

      If no name is given, the name is often left empty.
- concept:
    name: ecs.agent.type
    description: >
      Type of the agent.

      The agent type always stays the same and should be given by the agent
      used. In case of Filebeat the agent would always be Filebeat also if
      two Filebeat instances are run on the same machine.
- concept:
    name: ecs.agent.id
    description: >
      Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists).

      Example: For Beats this would be beat.id.
- concept:
    name: ecs.agent.ephemeral_id
    description: >
      Ephemeral identifier of this agent (if one exists).

      This id normally changes across restarts, but `agent.id` does not.
