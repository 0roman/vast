      Name of the file including the extension, without the directory.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.attributes
    description: >
      Array of file attributes.

      Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list
      of values that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory,

    description: >
      Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter,
      when appropriate.

      Drive letter where the file is located. This field is only relevant
      on Windows.

      The value should be uppercase, and not include the colon.

    name: ecs.file.path
    description: >
      Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the
      drive letter, when appropriate.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.target_path
    description: >-
      Target path for symlinks.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.extension
    description: >
      File extension, excluding the leading dot.

      Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz),
      only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.type
    description: >-
      File type (file, dir, or symlink).
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.device
    description: >-
      Device that is the source of the file.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.inode
    description: >-
      Inode representing the file in the filesystem.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.uid
    description: >
      The user ID (UID) or security identifier (SID) of the file owner.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.owner
    description: >-
      File owner's username.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.gid
    description: >-
      Primary group ID (GID) of the file.

    description: >-
      Primary group name of the file.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.mode
    description: >-
      Mode of the file in octal representation.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.size
    description: >

- concept:
    name: ecs.file.mtime
    description: >-
      Last time the file content was modified.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.ctime
    description: >
      Last time the file attributes or metadata changed.

      Note that changes to the file content will update `mtime`. This implies
      `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since `mtime` is an attribute
      of the file.
- concept:
    name: ecs.file.created
    description: >
      File creation time.

      Note that not all filesystems store the creation time.

      using https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[IANA

      the most specific type should be used.
