- concept:
    name: ecs.host.hostname
    description: >
      Hostname of the host.

      It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host
      machine.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.name
    description: >
      Name of the host.

      It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified
      domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which
      value to use.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.id
    description: >
      Unique host id.

      As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in
      your environment.

      Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.ip
    description: >
      Host ip addresses.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.mac
    description: >
      Host mac addresses.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.type
    description: >
      Type of host.

      For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If
      vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful
      in your environment.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.uptime
    description: >
      Seconds the host has been up.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.architecture
    description: >
      Operating system architecture.
- concept:
    name: ecs.host.domain
    description: >
      Name of the domain of which the host is a member.

      For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain
      or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's
      LDAP provider.
