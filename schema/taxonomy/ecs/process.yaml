- concept:
    name: ecs.process.pid
    description: >
      Process id.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.entity_id
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the process.

      The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some
      examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon
      Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of
      a process.

      Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate
      PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across
      multiple monitored hosts.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.name
    description: >
      Process name.

      Sometimes called program name or similar.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.ppid
    description: >
      Parent process' pid.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.pgid
    description: >
      Identifier of the group of processes the process belongs to.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.command_line
    description: >
      Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path
      to the executable, and all arguments.

      Some arguments may be filtered to protect sensitive information.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.args
    description: >
      Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable.

      May be filtered to protect sensitive information.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.args_count
    description: >
      Length of the process.args array.

      This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis
      on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments
      may be an indication of suspicious activity.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.executable
    description: >
      Absolute path to the process executable.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.title
    description: >
      Process title.

      The proctitle, some times the same as process name. Can also be different:
      for example a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.thread.id
    description: >
      Thread ID.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.thread.name
    description: >
      Thread name.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.start
    description: >
      The time the process started.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.uptime
    description: >
      Seconds the process has been up.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.working_directory
    description: >
      The working directory of the process.
- concept:
    name: ecs.process.exit_code
    description: >
      The exit code of the process, if this is a termination event.

      The field should be absent if there is no exit code for the event (e.g.
      process start).
