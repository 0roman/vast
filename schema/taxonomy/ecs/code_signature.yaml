    name: ecs.code_signature.exists
    description: >-
      Boolean to capture if a signature is present.
- concept:
    name: ecs.code_signature.subject_name
    description: >-
      Subject name of the code signer
- concept:
    name: ecs.code_signature.valid
    description: >
      Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the
      binary content.

      Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.
- concept:
    name: ecs.code_signature.trusted
    description: >
      Stores the trust status of the certificate chain.

      Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and
      this field should only be populated by tools that actively check the
      status.
- concept:
    name: ecs.code_signature.status
    description: >
      Additional information about the certificate status.

      This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate
      validity or trust status. Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust
      of the certificate was unchecked.
