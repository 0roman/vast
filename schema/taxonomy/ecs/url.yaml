- concept:
    name: ecs.url.original
    description: >
      Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.

      Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL,
      whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.

      This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete
      or not.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.full
    description: >
      If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in
      `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event
      source.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.scheme
    description: >
      Scheme of the request, such as "https".

      Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.domain
    description: >
      Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".

      In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without
      a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain`
      field.

      If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF
      RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the
      `domain` field.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.registered_domain
    description: >
      The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain.

      For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

      This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix
      list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply
      taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.top_level_domain
    description: >
      The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
      is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain
      for example.com is "com".

      This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix
      list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply
      taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as
      "co.uk".
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.subdomain
    description: >
      The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all
      of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a
      partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the
      full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names
      below the registered domain.

      For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east".
      If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
      the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.port
    description: >
      Port of the request, such as 443.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.path
    description: >
      Path of the request, such as "/search".
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.query
    description: >
      The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".

      The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`,
      there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field
      exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate
      between the two cases.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.extension
    description: >
      The field contains the file extension from the original request url,
      excluding the leading dot.

      The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a
      file extension.

      The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must
      be "png", not ".png".

      Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz),
      only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.fragment
    description: >
      Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".

      The `#` is not part of the fragment.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.username
    description: >
      Username of the request.
- concept:
    name: ecs.url.password
    description: >
      Password of the request.
