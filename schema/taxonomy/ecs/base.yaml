- concept:
    name: ecs.base.@timestamp
    description: >
      Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing
      when the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically
      populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.
- concept:
    name: ecs.base.tags
    description: >
      List of keywords used to tag each event.
- concept:
    name: ecs.base.labels
    description: >
      Custom key/value pairs.

      Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested
      objects. All values are stored as keyword.

      Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.
- concept:
    name: ecs.base.message
    description: >
      For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields
      can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
