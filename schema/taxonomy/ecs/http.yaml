- concept:
    name: ecs.http.request.method
    description: >
      HTTP request method.

      Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:

      "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."

      As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case
      of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will
      be mandated in ECS 2.0.0
- concept:
    name: ecs.http.request.mime_type
    description: >
      Mime type of the body of the request.

      This value must only be populated based on the content of the request
      body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
      request with the request's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
      threats or misconfigured clients.

      Mime type of the body of the response.

      This value must only be populated based on the content of the response
      body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a
      response with the response's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting
      misconfigured servers.
