      Content when writing string types.

      Populated as an array when writing string data to the registry. For
      single string registry types (REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ), this should be
      an array with one string. For sequences of string with REG_MULTI_SZ,
      this array will be variable length. For numeric data, such as REG_DWORD
      and REG_QWORD, this should be populated with the decimal representation
      (e.g `"1"`).

    name: ecs.registry.data.bytes
    description: >
      Original bytes written with base64 encoding.

      For Windows registry operations, such as SetValueEx and RegQueryValueEx,
      this corresponds to the data pointed by `lp_data`. This is optional
      but provides better recoverability and should be populated for REG_BINARY
      encoded values.
